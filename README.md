# Titanic-Data-Analysis
An exploratory data analysis and interesting insights from the Titanic dataset.

### Installation:
The libraries used in this analysis are,
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
Install them as the first step.

### Motivation:
The movie, "Titanic" sparked the curiosity and left the audience with a ton of questions in their mind. There are quite a number of holes in this theory that still makes us wonder several decades after this incident occurred. I'm sure each one of us have our own version of the Titanic story but lets look at what story the data has to tell about Titanic.

There were many assumptions made about this incident. To highlight a few,
1. There was an element of luck involved in the rescue process. Some passengers were prioritized over others such as upper-class ones. 
2. Women and infants had a higher survival rate over others.
3. Most of the passengers on board were alone without families.
4. There was close to 32% survival rate out of which, infants and old people more likely survived. 
5. Most of the passengers were middle-aged in the range of 15–30 years.

This analysis will give a better insight into the data and will help us answer some of these questions.

### Run:
I've used the Titanic dataset from the [Kaggle website]( https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic) and Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis.
The titanic_analysis.ipynb notebook has everything covered from data gathering to cleaning and analysis.

### Results:
I've made a blog post highlighting some of the key findings [here](https://medium.com/@shravanthi.m/deep-dive-into-titanic-798fb4d60572)
